# CS50
A repository for Harvard's CS50 assignments.

This repository contains my solutions, projects, and exercises for CS50's Python Programming Certification and CS50's Web Development Certification.

* **CS50P (Python Programming)**: Solutions and projects from the CS50P course, focusing on Python programming.
* **CS50W (Web Development)**: Solutions and projects from the CS50W course, focusing on web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Flask.

## CS50P (Python Programming)

This section contains my work from the **CS50P** course, which focuses on learning the fundamentals of Python programming. Topics covered include variables, conditionals, loops, functions, object-oriented programming, and more.
